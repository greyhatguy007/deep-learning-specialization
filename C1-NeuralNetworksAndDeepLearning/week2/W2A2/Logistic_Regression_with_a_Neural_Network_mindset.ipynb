    "# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.\n",
    "- Use `np.dot(X,Y)` to calculate dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn to:**\n",
    "- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:\n",
    "    - Initializing parameters\n",
    "    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient\n",
    "    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) \n",
    "- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/supplement/iLwon/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."
